# url_common

This is a Ruby gem for common URL related tasks.  I use this gem for most Ruby / Rails projects and I'm tried of copying a class library from project to project so I thought it would be better as a gem.

## Gem Creation Process

This was based on the instructions 

* [here](https://dev.to/aryaziai/how-to-create-a-ruby-gem-9m2) 
* and [here](https://bundler.io/guides/creating_gem.html)

(listed for reference because I am generally a gem consumer not a gem creator).
